          <h2>Why do I play Soccer?</h2>
          <p>I began to play soccer when I was a young, my parents encouraged I play so I could stay healthy when I was younger and they knew I would enjoy playing a sport later on. I still play soccer because I find it a relaxing <img src="images/ball.png" id="ball" alt="soccer ball" width="100px">and enjoyable activity I can do with friends.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

          <h2>Positions I Play</h2>
          <p>Most Soccer players have a position that they are better at than the othersand that position is often the one they are placed in the most by the coach. This position for me changed as I grew older and switched teams. I originally played as a left wing, but when I entered late Middle School, I began to become much better at left defense and that is my main position that I play now.<br><br></p>

          <h2>My Team</h2>
          <p><img src="images/team.png" id="team" alt="three people standing together" width="100px">I have a great team full of supportive and kind people. Playing Soccer has taught me how to use teamwork and how important it is to be nice and supportive of others to reach a common goal. Without playing soccer, I would never have been able to make so many close friends because the sport brought us all together.</p>

      <br><p>Even though I am olny a Freshman, I am excited to hopfully one day join the varsity team for soccer. It is an extremely difficult task, but I still wish that I will have a chance to play and even get to the playoffs.</p>

        <h2 class="locations">Indoor Soccer</h2>
        <p class="indoor">When the regular soccer season comes to an end in late October, I want to stay active throughout the winter. Indoor soccer helps a lot with staying active and healthy, even in the winter. My indoor soccer team is run by one of the parents of my outdoor team and the indoor team also has a lot of the same players. I often play indoor soccer at <a href="https://www.forekicks.com/" target="_blank"><em>4-Kicks</em></a> and even though the fields are small, it is still fun to play the smaller games against other teams. The teams are usually a five on five which is very small compared to previous eleven on eleven games. On top of that, the field is around only half the size making the each play much faster and allowing you to shoot the ball into the net as far back as half field.</p>
